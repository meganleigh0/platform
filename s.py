I understand the stakes involved in this field, and although I am continuously learning, my applied coursework and hands-on projects have provided me with invaluable experience. Attached are a cloud migration proposal and an affinity wall project that were successfully delivered to external companies—both projects received positive feedback.

I am committed to collaborating, problem-solving, and delivering data-driven insights. I look forward to discussing how my background and ongoing work can contribute to your team’s objectives.
