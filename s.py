Summary:

Azure Data Factory (ADF) is ideal for orchestrating data movement and basic transformations between different data stores. It's not designed for complex data processing, advanced analytics, or running custom Python code with extensive libraries.

Azure Synapse Analytics offers an integrated environment for big data analytics and data warehousing. It includes Synapse Pipelines (built on ADF) for data integration and supports both SQL and Spark for data processing. However, it may have limitations with Python library support and is less mature in handling advanced data science tasks compared to Databricks.

Azure Databricks provides a collaborative environment optimized for big data analytics, data science, and machine learning workloads. It offers full support for Python and extensive libraries required for complex data processing tasks like natural language processing (NLP) and simulations using SimPy.
