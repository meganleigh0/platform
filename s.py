Question: How many builds are happening in subassemblies on the assembly line, and how can those operations be rearranged? We aimed to determine if tasks, like bench work, could be adjusted to improve man loading.

Outcome: We categorized nearly a thousand operations per program into six flexible groups, which can be adjusted as needed. This approach helps identify operational dependencies and capture key processes like dry time after paint for better modeling.

Outcome: Using NLP, we categorized nearly a thousand operations per program into six flexible groups. This allows us to adjust categories as needed, helping to identify operational dependencies and capture key processes, like dry time after paint, for more accurate modeling.
