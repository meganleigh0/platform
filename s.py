Subject: Additional Concerns Regarding Spark Versioning and Cost with Azure Synapse vs Databricks

Dear [Recipient’s Name],

After further research, I wanted to raise some specific concerns about using Azure Synapse for our data processing needs, particularly regarding Apache Spark versioning and cost implications when compared to Azure Databricks.

1. Spark Version Lock-In with Synapse

Azure Synapse has version lock-in concerns. It lags behind in releasing the latest versions of Apache Spark, which means Synapse users are often working with outdated Spark versions (e.g., Synapse is still using Spark 3.3 while Databricks has more recent versions like Spark 3.5). This can limit the ability to use the newest features, performance optimizations, and improvements that are regularly introduced in the Spark ecosystem. Moreover, upgrading between versions in Synapse can require creating new Spark pools, which can be resource-intensive and disruptive to ongoing projects. For instance, Spark version 3.3 in Synapse will stop being supported soon, requiring migrations to more recent versions ￼ ￼.

Databricks, on the other hand, continuously provides the latest Spark releases and optimizations, offering greater flexibility and allowing us to stay current with Spark’s evolving capabilities. This is critical for advanced data processing tasks like the ones we’re running, particularly with Python and NLP libraries ￼.

2. Cost and Scalability Considerations

Even if Synapse could technically handle the work we need to do, it wouldn’t be efficient in terms of cost. Azure Synapse is primarily built for SQL-based analytics and structured data. Trying to use it for complex data processing tasks involving unstructured data, like ours, would require significant computational resources, leading to much higher costs due to inefficiencies. Synapse doesn’t handle real-time processing or large-scale data transformations as effectively as Databricks, especially with Spark Streaming and Delta Lake ￼.

In contrast, Azure Databricks is designed for scalable data processing with optimized Spark performance, which means it will be much more cost-effective for handling large datasets and complex transformations over time. The native auto-scaling features in Databricks, coupled with better resource management for data science workflows, would lead to significant savings as the project scales ￼.

3. Alternative with Delta Lake and Open-Source Tools

If Databricks isn’t an option, we could consider an open-source approach using Delta Lake for managing large datasets and Apache Spark for distributed data processing. However, this would require more setup and maintenance compared to Databricks, which offers a managed environment that reduces operational overhead.

Conclusion

Given these considerations, Azure Databricks remains the most suitable option for our project. It offers better Spark version support, is more scalable for our complex data processing needs, and would ultimately be more cost-effective in the long run. I recommend we move forward with Databricks to ensure we have the right tools for Python-based processing, NLP tasks, and real-time simulations.
