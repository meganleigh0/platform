Hi Jim,

Thank you for reaching out. Our team has been focused on predicting schedules, hours per unit (HPU), and modeling the manufacturing process while integrating supply chain data into these predictions. Throughout this process, we’ve encountered significant discrepancies in the data received from various sources, which has required extensive cleaning using Python. Unfortunately, Synapse doesn’t fully support Python, and we rely heavily on it for cleaning, structuring, and processing data, especially when mapping data from Oracle with information from other teams.

As we’ve been progressing through our projects, we’re starting to realize that while a lot of the information seems consolidated, it’s quite different from how many other teams are approaching things. A lot of the knowledge resides with individuals, meaning we’ve had to engage in ongoing conversations to figure out what certain processes or data actually mean. Many of these dependencies aren’t always documented and require direct communication to understand, which has been a key part of comparing and refining the data we’re working with.

Given the complexities and the way our projects are evolving, it seems like Databricks might better support these needs, particularly when it comes to managing the extensive communication and data dependencies. That said, we’re still refining our understanding, and I think it would be helpful for our team to also confirm our direction since there are so many teams engaged in these initiatives.

Looking forward to chatting more and syncing up on this.

Best,
Megan
