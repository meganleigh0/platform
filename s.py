Subject: Data Cleansing and Recommendation for Azure Databricks

Dear Team,

I hope you’re all doing well. I wanted to share some thoughts on our current data initiatives and propose a solution that I believe will benefit our group.

Firstly, I think it’s essential that we focus on data cleansing and gaining a clear context of our data. This involves:

	•	Collaborating with the Data Governance Team: Understanding the attributes they’ve assigned to our data and how it’s being managed.
	•	Confirming Data Accuracy: Verifying that the information we have is correct and reliable before we proceed further.

By ensuring our data is clean and well-understood, we’ll be better positioned to make informed decisions and drive our project forward effectively.

Secondly, as we plan to use a cloud platform tool for our data processing and analytics, I strongly believe that Azure Databricks would be the best solution for our group. After looking into various services, I’ve found that Databricks offers:

	•	Robust Data Processing Capabilities: Ideal for handling large volumes of data and complex transformations.
	•	Advanced Collaboration Features: Supports teamwork through shared notebooks and real-time collaboration.
	•	Scalability: Can easily scale to meet our growing data needs across multiple plants.
	•	Integration with Azure Services: Seamlessly works with tools like Azure Data Lake Storage and Power BI.

I’ve attached a detailed recommendation outlining why I think Azure Databricks is the optimal choice for us.

I’m excited about the potential this brings to our project and look forward to discussing this with all of you. Please feel free to share your thoughts or any questions you might have.
