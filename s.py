Write this more concise for people who don’t understand NLP processing: Slide Text:

Initially, we were interested in seeing how many builds were happening in subassemblies on the assembly line and how those operations could maybe get rearranged. The goal was to figure out if certain tasks, like those done on the bench, could be adjusted to improve man loading by looking at the builds.

One of the main assignment files already had sections identified, and for the others, we realized we could pull that from the operator data later on. But overall, we wanted to find a way to classify the nearly thousand operations across these files—by program, by rate—so we could model this process more effectively. This led to creating a cleaner method of categorizing the different operations, helping us figure out how to bend those into something we can model and improve.

This keeps it casual but still conveys the key points of your process. Let me know if you’d like any further tweaks!
