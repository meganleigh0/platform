Here’s a simplified and professional version:

Hi Jim,

Thank you for reaching out. Our team has been focused on predicting schedules, hours per unit (HPU), and modeling the manufacturing process, while incorporating supply chain data into these predictions. We’ve run into some challenges with inconsistent data formats and gaps, which has required significant data cleaning using Python. Since we rely on Python for much of this work, Synapse hasn’t been the best fit, particularly when integrating data from Oracle and other sources.

Additionally, many of the processes and dependencies aren’t always well-documented, so we’ve been spending time communicating with various teams to gather the necessary information. This has helped us better understand the data, but it has also added complexity to our work.

Given these challenges, Databricks seems like it might be a better fit for our needs, especially for data manipulation and collaboration across teams. That said, we’re still evaluating our approach and would value any input as we move forward.

Looking forward to discussing this further.

Best,
Megan
