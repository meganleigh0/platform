Report and Recommendation: Selecting the Optimal Tool for Our Project

Project Overview

Our project aims to develop a comprehensive planning and tracking tool to optimize manufacturing operations. This involves:

	•	Data Integration: Combining data from Oracle E-Business Suite, Solumina MES, CSV files, and Workforce Management systems.
	•	Data Cleansing and Processing: Using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to clean and standardize complex and unstructured data.
	•	Simulation and Modeling: Employing SimPy for Discrete Event Simulation (DES) to model production schedules and workloads.
	•	Collaboration and Scalability: Facilitating teamwork and ensuring the solution can scale as we incorporate data from additional plants.

Comparison of Azure Services

Azure Data Factory (ADF)

	•	Purpose: Data integration and orchestration tool for moving and transforming data.
	•	Limitations:
	•	Cannot run complex Python scripts or support advanced data cleansing with NLP.
	•	Unsuitable for running simulations or complex data processing tasks.

Azure Synapse Analytics

	•	Purpose: Integrated analytics service combining data warehousing and big data analytics.
	•	Limitations:
	•	Limited support for necessary Python libraries, especially for NLP and SimPy.
	•	Less optimal for running complex simulations and collaborative data science workflows.

Azure Databricks (Recommended)

	•	Purpose: Collaborative analytics platform optimized for big data processing and machine learning.
	•	Advantages:
	•	Full Python Support: Seamlessly integrates with Python and required libraries for data cleansing, NLP, and SimPy simulations.
	•	Advanced Data Processing: Efficiently handles large datasets and complex transformations.
	•	Optimized for Simulations: Provides computational power needed for efficient SimPy simulations.
	•	Collaboration Tools: Interactive notebooks and real-time collaboration enhance teamwork.
	•	Scalability: Easily scales to accommodate growing data volumes and computational needs.
	•	Integration: Works smoothly with Azure services like Data Lake Storage and Power BI for data storage and visualization.

Recommendation

Based on our project requirements, Azure Databricks is the optimal choice now and for future growth. It meets all our needs:

	•	Data Processing: Supports complex data cleansing and NLP tasks using Python.
	•	Simulation Capabilities: Efficiently runs SimPy simulations essential for modeling our production processes.
	•	Collaboration: Facilitates teamwork with interactive notebooks and shared workspaces.
	•	Scalability: Capable of handling increasing data volumes from multiple plants.
	•	Integration: Seamless connectivity with our data sources and visualization tools.

Why Not ADF or Azure Synapse?

	•	Azure Data Factory lacks the ability to run complex Python scripts and is unsuitable for advanced data processing.
	•	Azure Synapse Analytics has limitations with Python library support and may not efficiently handle our simulations, making it less suitable for our project.

Next Steps

	•	Set Up Azure Databricks: Establish a workspace and configure clusters with necessary libraries.
	•	Data Ingestion: Connect to data sources and begin importing data into Databricks.
	•	Develop Processing Pipelines: Create notebooks for data cleansing and transformation using Python and NLP.
	•	Build Simulations: Develop and run SimPy models within Databricks.
	•	Create Dashboards: Use Power BI connected to Databricks for data visualization and reporting.
	•	Plan for Growth: Ensure the architecture is scalable to include additional plants and more complex analyses.

Conclusion

Azure Databricks provides the necessary tools and environment to meet our project’s current and future needs. Its strengths in data processing, simulation, collaboration, and scalability make it the best platform for us to use as we develop and expand our planning and tracking tool.
