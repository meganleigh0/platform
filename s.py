I fully understand that this isn’t school—this is real-life work with real stakes. While I’m pursuing an applied master’s program, I recognize that there’s a lot more to learn beyond the classroom. That said, the hands-on, project-based nature of my program has provided valuable, practical experience that I’ve tried to share where relevant. I know I don’t know everything, but I believe there’s a lot I’ve learned through these projects that can help contribute meaningfully. The attached documents—a cloud migration proposal and an affinity wall—showcase some of that applied work, both of which were delivered for external companies who were happy with the results.
