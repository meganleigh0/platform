My interest in data science began in 2016 when my stepfather introduced me to the field, recognizing its growth potential and alignment with my skills. In 2018, I pursued a Bachelor’s in Data Science & Analytics at Eastern Michigan University Honors College, becoming one of the first 12 graduates from the program. The interdisciplinary curriculum, drawing from mathematics, statistics, computer science, and business, provided a strong foundation, especially in data science theory.

After graduation, I joined GDLS as a data analyst contractor in the reliability department, initially focusing on cleansing and scoring Test Incident Report (TIR) data. I later developed an assembly prediction model using a multi-level MBOM and depth-first search algorithm. Additionally, I collaborated on a discrete event simulation to model assembly processes, incorporating labor standards and floor layouts, which enabled efficiency analyses and scenario modeling.

Alongside my work, I enrolled in the competitive Master of Applied Data Science (MADS) program at the University of Michigan, where I am currently completing my final credits. As president of the Masters of Applied Data Science Association (MADSA), I lead initiatives like advanced data science workshops and volunteer programs.

Throughout my career and studies, I’ve focused on the full data science lifecycle—from data sourcing and cleansing to modeling and deployment. I’ve consistently emphasized the importance of data preparation and integrity, advocating for a structured approach to ensure meaningful model outcomes. This perspective has often required me to challenge the notion that data science is solely about building models.

I’ve also contributed to cloud migration projects, evaluating on-prem architecture and designing cloud strategies, although my expertise lies primarily in data science. I’m currently working on an NLP-driven machine learning project as part of a “Data for Good” initiative, continually sourcing new information to stay proactive in this evolving field.

In my approach, I remain collaborative, open to feedback, and committed to solving complex problems through data-driven insights. I’ve attached a cloud proposal and affinity wall project I completed, which illustrate my experience. Despite facing some challenges, I remain dedicated to advancing my skills and contributing meaningfully to the data science field.
