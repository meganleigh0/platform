Subject: Concerns with Current Approach and Why Azure Databricks is the Better Option

Dear [Recipient’s Name],

I wanted to address some concerns about the tools we’re considering for our project, particularly the limitations with Azure Synapse for handling our specific data needs and why Azure Databricks seems to be a more appropriate fit.

1. Data Quality Challenges

We’re dealing with data from various sources, including Oracle, Solumina, and manually maintained Excel workbooks. While not all data from Oracle is inaccurate, there are significant quality concerns with the manually updated data. We have inconsistencies in formats and data entry, and we’re still working to identify gaps. Given the complexity of the data and the need for thorough cleansing, we require a robust tool for data processing.

2. Spark in Azure Synapse vs. Azure Databricks

Both Azure Synapse and Azure Databricks use Apache Spark, but there are key differences:

	•	Synapse Spark is more integrated into Synapse’s broader platform for data warehousing and analytics. However, it’s primarily designed for SQL-based data analytics at scale, and its Spark integration is less mature compared to Databricks. This impacts flexibility when running complex Python libraries, like those used for natural language processing (NLP) or advanced simulations. Synapse also has limitations around dependency management and customization for Python-based workflows ￼ ￼.
	•	Azure Databricks is built for data engineering and data science, with full support for advanced Python processing and Spark libraries. It is designed specifically for handling large, messy datasets like ours. Databricks provides better support for complex Python scripting, such as those required for NLP, SimPy simulations, and real-time processing ￼. Additionally, Databricks integrates tightly with Delta Lake, which allows for efficient data storage and management, along with features like auto-scaling and collaborative notebooks, which are essential for team-based data science projects ￼ ￼.

3. Synapse Pipeline and ADF Cleaning Limitations

Azure Synapse Pipelines (based on Azure Data Factory) are excellent for simple data transformations and orchestration, but they fall short when it comes to handling the complex data transformations we need. ADF isn’t designed to support the detailed Python data cleaning and parsing we require. Databricks, on the other hand, allows us to write and execute Python scripts more flexibly and manage dependencies in a way that Synapse cannot ￼.

4. Why Azure Databricks is the Best Option

Given the complexity of our data and the processing needs, Azure Databricks is the best solution for our project because it:

	•	Provides better support for Python and advanced data processing.
	•	Offers more customization and control over data transformations, necessary for cleansing and validating our data.
	•	Allows us to integrate our Python-based tools and workflows, including simulations with SimPy.
	•	Is more suited for handling messy, unstructured data through its optimized Spark engine and Delta Lake architecture.

5. Alternative Open-Source Tools

If Databricks is not an option, we could consider an open-source approach using tools like:

	•	Delta Lake: For managing large datasets with ACID transactions.
	•	Apache Spark: For distributed data processing.
	•	Airflow: For orchestrating complex data workflows and automating tasks.
These tools would give us flexibility, though we’d lose some of the managed services and integrations that Databricks offers.

Recommendation

I recommend we move forward with Azure Databricks. It offers the flexibility, scalability, and full Python support that are critical for our data processing and simulation needs. It’s also well-suited for managing large datasets as the project expands, and it integrates well with Power BI for visualization.
