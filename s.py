Hi Dimitri,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to follow up on my mention last week about the machine learning pipeline. Since then, I’ve gotten involved in a project called Data4Good, which partners with NGOs to deliver data-driven solutions while providing practical project experience for students.

I’ve written quite a few machine learning pipelines at this point, having completed all of my coursework in supervised learning, unsupervised learning, machine learning fundamentals, and pipelines. I feel confident in my ability to work on projects like this, which is why I got involved when Terry and Carl joined. I’m supporting this project not only to help out but also to gain industry experience with machine learning outside of my academic program.

Right now, I’m working on the deployment side of a machine learning model that curates and summarizes reports sent to the United Nations, automating manual tasks. It’s been a great opportunity to apply my skills, and I’m really enjoying it.

Let me know if you’d like to hear more or discuss anything related to the pipeline!

Best,
[Your Name]
