Subject: Update on Simulation and Data Visualization

Hi Brent,

I hope you’re doing well.

Solumna is running smoothly, and I appreciate you checking in. Currently, we are executing the simulation locally using the Senpai library, which produces a CSV log of the results. Afterward, we use that log, along with others generated from the simulation, to create various visualizations.

The animations are developed in Python using the Plotly library, and we save them as HTML files for easy viewing. I’ve attached those HTML files for you to review. These represent the results from our Model 2, which incorporates the MBOM and Labor Standards.

Since our recent visit to JSMC, we’ve received a lot of valuable input. We’re now working on addressing some of the discrepancies in the data we initially used and aligning it more closely with their processes, as we’ve discovered some significant differences in execution. Our current focus is on cleansing, mapping, and organizing the data properly so we can accurately model it moving forward.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
